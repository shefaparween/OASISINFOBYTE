Hello Everyone, I am SHEFA. I am 2ND Year B.SC (IT) student. I am doing my B.SC IN (Information Technology) from MAULANA ABUL KALAM AZAD UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,WSET BENGAL.
I came to know about the internship at Oasis Infobyte from LinkedIn. I was looking for an internship where I can implement my knowledge and skills. Thanks to Oasis Infobyte for giving me this opportunity.
Having basic knowledge and interest in Web development, I chose the Web Development and Designing domain for the internship.
I have done three tasks in the Level-2 category.
Task 1: Making a Calculator
Task 2: Making a Tribute Page
Task 3: Making a Todo Web App
It was a great experience working with Oasis Infobyte, Great learning experience and it has helped me a lot in sharpening and smoothing my skills. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to do the Web Development and Designing Internship(JUNE  Batch, 2023).
